homeown is a tiny Windows application that allows system administrators to automate following tedious task: take ownership, recursively reset permissions to Domain Admins: Full Control and Owner: Modify. This is a command line utility that takes full folder path as a parameter and extracts last part as the username (so the last folder name in the path should equal to actual username). You need to have Domain Admin rights to execute it. Included is full source code.
